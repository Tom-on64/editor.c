editor.c - A simple, vi-like editor
===================================

This is a simple, no dependency, vi-like editor written in ~1000 lines of C code.

Usage
-----
You can launch the editor with a filename to open that file or just by itself
to create an empty buffer. You can then use common vi bindings to edit your 
files. Valid motions/bindings in NORMAL mode are:
* 'h', 'j', 'k' & 'l' for single character movement
* 'w', 'W', 'b' & 'B' for word movement
* '_' & '$' for start and end of line respectively
* 'g' & 'G' for start and end of file respectively
* 'x' & 'X' for delete and backspace
* 'i' to enter insert mode at cursor
* 'I' to enter insert mode at start of line
* 'a' to enter insert mode 1 character after cursor
* 'A' to enter insert mode at end of line
* 'o' to enter insert mode on a new line below cursor
* 'O' to enter insert mode on a new line above cursor
* ':' to enter command mode

You can use <ESC> or ^C to leave INSERT mode.

Here's a list of valid commands in COMMAND mode:
* q [filename] - quit the editor
* w [filename] - write file to disk
* e [filename] - edit a file

The [filename] argument is optional and is by default the current working
filename. Any of these may be followed by a '!' to ignore warnings and force
the command. You may also type 'wq [filename]' to write and quit the editor.

Building
--------
You should be able to compile this on any unix-like OS as long as you have:
* gcc
* glibc

Issues
------
If you encounter a bug (and believe me, you will), please report it in the
issues tab or fix it yourself and submit a pull request.
